# Iteration 3

* Note: To login to the app, Use username: "Me" and password: "123"

* Note: When running the ImageTest system test (and using the camera in the app for the first time in general) the user will recieve a prompt asking permission to let Spenditure use the camera. The user must press "While using the app" when this message appears within 10 seconds or else the system test will time out and fail. Rob said this was an acceptable implementation.

* When you create a transaction, there is the field called "What the heck?", this is title of transaction (git blame: Jill). We got comment on this in the last 2 iterations, so it is worth to note here.

* There is no system test for our security feature because that was entirely done in the backend (by using hashing in logic and the db), so our other system tests cover it already.


## Features:

* Financial goal tracker

* Illustrative report manager 

* User authentication

* System tests

* Notification system

* Financial accountability reminders


### Completed:

* Financial goal tracker

* Illustrative report manager 

* User authentication

* System tests

### Not complete (Push to future iteration):

* Notification system

* Financial accountability reminders

As the plan made at the beginning of the project, these two features are the least significant. Along with time constraint, we decide to push these features for the next iteration (future iteration).
